FIAT 500 Vs FIAT 500 Abarth

need to find the following data:
- sprung mass (ms)-->remember to divide the total mass of the body by 4
- unsprung mass (mus)--> include wheel and tire weight, partial weight of a suspension system, brake system and 
  I think also the upright and hub weight
- stiffness of unsprung (kus)
- stiffness of sprung (ks)
- dumping of unsprung (cus)
- dumping of sprung (cs)

goal of the simulation:
-find the best kp,kd and maybe the ki of the PID using the optimazer (mandatory)
-find the optimal value of ks and cs using the optimazer (optional) 

other possible work:
-find and "explain" the sunspension type for the front and rear tyre
-compare the two different model data or at least the objective of the suspension system for these two model and how
 to achieve it.
